# Tic Tac Toe (with a twist!)

Try it out [here](https://ajshopov.github.io/tictactoe/).

### Brief

General Assembly WDI Project 1. Create a Noughts & Crosses game, then add your own fun and interesting approach to this classic.

### Solution

In addition to building the standard Tic Tac Toe game, I included a display box showing the active player, a scoreboard that saves results through local storage and a score reset button.

For some extra flair, the game has a Mario-themed skin that can be toggled on during gameplay. The skin changes the X and O icons, fonts, background and plays the Mario theme music.
